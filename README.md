# <Horiseon's accessibility>

## Description
Improve a starter code to make sure it meets all the criteria of accessibility.
It is extremely important part of the job as accessibility is a big criterion in search engines ranking.
I made this assignment because it is essential to know how code must be written so that it meets the right criteria for search engines.
I've learned a lot about HTML semantics, accessibility, code order and good practise in coding.
